About the project: 


Instructions to implement on google colab:
1. Upload the data files to google drive
2. Mount google drive to access the files( command in code)
3. Change data path to your google drive path
4. Test for the five diffrent .txt files provided
5. Uncomment the part of the code to check for position of the match
